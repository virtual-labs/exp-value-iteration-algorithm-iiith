## Step 1:
In practice section double click/ single click to modify the cells as terminal states or blocked states
## Step 2:
Modify the parameters and the grid size by changing values in the control menu

## Step 3:
The grid represents the state value function for each state : Left, Up, Right and Downx
## Step 4: 
Click on next value to go to the next step in the current iteration, the state function of next state will be calculated. Once reached a terminal state or max steps allowed per iteration, the iteration count will be increased and steps will be 0.
## Step 5:
Click on the next iteration to go to the next iteration.

## Step 6:
The arrows in the left grid represent the currently learned policy.

## Step 7:
Once the state value functions of every state values converge (optimal policy selected) a message would be displayed
